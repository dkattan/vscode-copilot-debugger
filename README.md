# Copilot Breakpoint Debugger (Preview)

Use GitHub Copilot (or any LM-enabled workflow in VS Code) to start, inspect, and resume debug sessions automatically with conditional breakpoints, hit conditions, and logpoints.

## ✨ Features

The extension contributes Language Model Tools that Copilot can invoke:

1. **Start Debugger** (`start_debugger_with_breakpoints`) – Launch a configured debug session and wait for the first breakpoint (optionally set new breakpoints or filter variables).
2. **Resume Debug Session** (`resume_debug_session`) – Continue execution of an existing paused session and optionally wait for the next stop.
3. **Get Variables** (`get_variables`) – Retrieve all variables in the current top stack frame scopes.
4. **Expand Variable** (`expand_variable`) – Drill into a single variable to inspect its immediate children.

All tools return structured data that Copilot can reason over (JSON-like text parts containing call stacks, variables, and metadata).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace (coming soon). For now, clone the repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkattan/vscode-copilot-debugger.git
cd vscode-copilot-debugger
npm install
npm run compile
```

1. Open the folder in VS Code.

1. Set a default launch configuration name or inline JSON in your settings:

```jsonc
// settings.json
{
  "copilot-debugger.defaultLaunchConfiguration": "Launch Program",
}
```

1. Start interacting with Copilot Chat. It can now reference the tools by name.

## 🔧 Configuration

`copilot-debugger.defaultLaunchConfiguration` – The name of a `launch.json` configuration OR an inline JSON object (e.g. `{"type":"node","request":"launch","program":"${workspaceFolder}/index.js"}`).

## 🧪 Example Copilot Prompts

```text
Start the debugger and stop at the first breakpoint; only show variables matching ^PWD$.
```

```text
Resume the last debug session, add a breakpoint at src/server.ts line 42, and wait for it to hit.
```

## 🐞 Debug Info Returned

Responses include:

- Breakpoint hit metadata (file, line, reason)
- Call stack (threads, frames, source info)
- Scoped variables (filtered if requested)
- Variable expansion (children)

## 🔐 Privacy / Telemetry

This extension does **not** collect or transmit telemetry. All processing occurs locally via the VS Code Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP). If telemetry is added in the future, this section will document exactly what is sent and how to opt out.

## ♿ Accessibility

All commands are exposed as LM tools and can be invoked via keyboard using Copilot Chat. Output is provided as text parts suitable for screen readers. Please open issues for any accessibility improvements.

### Development Scripts

- `npm run watch` – Incremental TypeScript compilation
- `npm test` – Compiles then runs test suite
- `npm run lint` – ESLint static analysis
- `npm run format` – Auto-format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` – Check formatting without changes

### Testing

#### Automated Local Testing

When you open this workspace in VS Code, a task automatically configures git hooks that run all checks before each commit:

1. **Format Check** - Ensures code follows Prettier rules
2. **Linter** - Runs ESLint
3. **TypeScript Compilation** - Verifies code compiles
4. **Tests** - Runs the full test suite

This ensures quality code is committed without relying on CI for feedback.

#### Test Organization

- **Unit Tests**: `src/test/extension.test.ts`, `src/test/getStackFrameVariables.test.ts`
- **Integration Tests (Node.js)**: `src/test/*.node.test.ts` - Test debug functionality with Node.js
- **Integration Tests (PowerShell)**: `src/test/*.test.ts` (non-.node) - Test with PowerShell (local only)

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in CI mode (skips PowerShell-only tests)
CI=true npm test
```

#### Test Execution Notes

Do not run individual compiled test files (e.g. `node out/test/evaluateExpressionTool.test.js`) directly — Mocha's globals (`describe`, `it`) won't be initialized and you'll see `ReferenceError: describe is not defined`. Always use the harness (`npm test`) so the VS Code extension host and programmatic Mocha runner set up the environment.

Each test file explicitly imports Mocha functions (`import { describe, it } from 'mocha';`) to make intent clear and guard against accidental direct execution when using tooling that doesn't inject globals.

You can optionally install the "Extension Test Runner" (`ms-vscode.extension-test-runner`) extension to view and run tests from the VS Code Test Explorer UI. This provides granular pass/fail indicators and single-test debug without replacing the existing CLI harness. Keep `npm test` as the source of truth for CI parity.

#### CI Testing Strategy

Integration tests that start actual debug sessions are **skipped in CI** because:

- VS Code debug sessions don't reliably initialize in headless CI environments
- Even Microsoft's official extension samples skip complex debugging tests in CI
- Tests run automatically via git hooks before local commits

PowerShell-based tests are skipped in CI since they require PowerShell runtime. The Node.js test equivalents provide the same coverage using JavaScript.

### Using VS Code Insiders for Development (Recommended Dual Setup)

Due to a current VS Code limitation, running extension integration tests **from the command line** only works when no other instance of VS Code (Stable) is already running. To keep a smooth inner loop (edit + debug) while still validating tests via CLI, use a dual-install setup:

**Pattern:**

| Activity                                                     | VS Code Edition |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Day-to-day development (editing, live debugging, Chat)       | Insiders        |
| Running `npm test` (CLI harness via `@vscode/test-electron`) | Stable          |

**Why this works:** The test runner (see `src/test/runTest.ts`) downloads a fresh Stable build into `.vscode-test/` and launches it headlessly. If you only have Insiders open, the Stable process can start cleanly without colliding with an existing instance.

#### Setup Steps

1. Install both VS Code Stable and VS Code Insiders.
1. Use Insiders for development: open this repo in **VS Code Insiders** normally.
1. Run tests from a terminal (outside any currently running Stable window):

```bash
npm test
```

1. If you need to debug tests interactively, use the built-in debug configuration (Run and Debug view) instead of the pure CLI.

#### Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Running extension tests from the command line is currently only supported if no other instance of Code is running.` | A Stable window is open while CLI tries to start Stable for tests | Close all VS Code Stable windows; keep only Insiders open                                            |
| Tests hang at startup                                                                                                | Conflicting user-data or extensions dir locked                    | Clear `.vscode-test/` directory or ensure previous test process exited                               |
| Breakpoints in test files not hit                                                                                    | Running compiled JS without early pause                           | Set `TEST_TS_NODE=1` env var or rely on the existing `--inspect-brk-extensions` logic for local runs |

#### Optional Convenience Aliases (macOS / zsh)

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias vscodes='open -a "Visual Studio Code"'
alias codei='open -a "Visual Studio Code - Insiders"'
```

Then:

```bash
codei .   # develop
npm test  # run tests (Stable headless)
```

#### Running Tests Inside the Editor

If you prefer not to manage dual installs, you can run and debug tests from the **Insiders** editor (Run and Debug view) using a launch configuration that points to `out/test/runTest.js`. This avoids the CLI constraint but ties up the Insiders window until tests finish.

### Test Channel Selection (Default: Insiders Locally, Stable in CI)

Local runs now default to the **Insiders** build for closer parity with your development editor. CI remains on Stable for reproducibility.

Override locally to Stable:

```bash
TEST_USE_STABLE=1 npm test
```

Combine with TypeScript source debugging:

```bash
TEST_USE_STABLE=1 TEST_TS_NODE=1 npm test
```

Environment logic:

| Context             | Channel  | How to change           |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| CI (process.env.CI) | Stable   | Not changeable (fixed)  |
| Local default       | Insiders | Set `TEST_USE_STABLE=1` |
| Local forced stable | Stable   | `TEST_USE_STABLE=1`     |

Log output confirms selection (e.g. `Downloading VS Code channel: insiders`).
